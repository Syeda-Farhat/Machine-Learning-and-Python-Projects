This Repository containing portfolio of Machine Learning and Python projects completed by me for academic, and self learning purposes. ML-based projects are in the form of Jupyter notebooks, and Python project are .py files. The Python Projects using different types of data structures, functions and techniques. 
## Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally
1. Install dependencies using requirements.txt (if available in project folder) otherwise required libraries are mentioned at the start of each notebook.
2. Run notebooks as usual by using a jupyter notebook server, colab, VScode etc.
3. Dataset downloadable link is mentioned in each project description.
