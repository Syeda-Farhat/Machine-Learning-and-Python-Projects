# Machine Learning and Data Science Porfolio
This Repository containing portfolio of Machine Learning and Data Science projects completed by me for academic, and self learning purposes. ML-based projects are in the form of Jupyter notebooks, and Python project are .py files. The Python Projects using different types of data structures, functions and techniques. 
## Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally
1. Install dependencies using requirements.txt (if available in project folder) otherwise required libraries are mentioned at the start of each notebook.
2. Run notebooks as usual by using a jupyter notebook server, colab, VScode etc.
3. Dataset or downloadable link is mentioned in each project folder.
# Projects 
   ### Machine Learning 
   * [House Price Prediction](https://github.com/Syeda-Farhat/Machine-Learning-and-Python-Projects/blob/main/House_price_prediction%20(1).ipynb)  : This project employs Linear Regression and Random Forest regression models for the prediction of house prices and dataset is available at [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shibumohapatra/house-price). It further enhances model performance through feature engineering and utilizes GridSearchCV for optimal hyperparameter tuning, ensuring accurate and robust price predictions.
   * [Handwritten Digit Recognition using NN and SVM](https://github.com/Syeda-Farhat/Machine-Learning-and-Python-Projects/blob/main/Handritten_digit_recognition_using_NN_and_SVM.ipynb)  : This project aimed to develop a versatile handwritten digit recognition system using two different machine learning approaches: a Neural Network (NN) and a Support Vector Machine (SVM). The objective was to recognize and classify images of handwritten digits with high accuracy and NN predict the higher accuracy.
   * [Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/Syeda-Farhat/Machine-Learning-and-Python-Projects/tree/main/Recommendation_System) : This project delve into the world of recommendation systems, which utilize algorithms to offer personalized suggestions to users, with a focus on content-based and collaborative filtering approaches.
   * [Human Activity Recognition with Smartphones](https://github.com/Syeda-Farhat/Machine-Learning-and-Python-Projects/tree/main/Human%20Activity%20Prediction%20with%20Smartphones)  : This project is about classifying the human activities based on the smartphone data. The dataset is downloaded from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/human-activity-recognition-with-smartphones). Data consist of various features and activitives. In this project used classification algorithims and also apply feature selection methods.
   * [ML-Based Stock Market Prediction](https://github.com/Syeda-Farhat/Machine-Learning-and-Python-Projects/blob/main/ML_Based_Stock_market_prediction.ipynb)  : This project aims to predict tomorrow's S&P 500 index price by utilizing historical data. It begins by downloading S&P 500 price data through the 'yfinance' package, proceeds with data cleaning and preprocessing using pandas, and ultimately prepares the dataset for machine learning applications.
   * [Customer Segmentation using k-mean CLustering](https://github.com/Syeda-Farhat/Machine-Learning-and-Python-Projects/blob/main/Customer_Segmentation_using_K_Means_Clustering.ipynb)  : This project demonstrates the application of unsupervised learning, specifically K-Means clustering, to segment customers based on their annual income and spending ratio. The dataset used for this analysis is obtained from [kaggel](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python) and consists of customer information.
   ### Python
   * [Rock Paper and Scissor Game](https://github.com/Syeda-Farhat/Machine-Learning-and-Python-Projects/tree/main/Rock-Paper-Scissor)  : The Game includes a simple logic encapsulated in an unconditional while loop, encompassing key steps of user input retrieval, validation, and random computer input generation. The game's progression is defined by a concise if-elif-else statement that enforces the game rules. 
   * [The Minesweeper Game](https://github.com/Syeda-Farhat/Machine-Learning-and-Python-Projects/tree/main/minesweeper)  : This Python-based mine detection game, also known as Minesweeper, challenges players to uncover hidden mines within a grid of cells. Clicking on a mine results in a loss, while numbers displayed in cells reveal the count of adjacent mines. To aid in gameplay, users can mark potential mines with a right-click, creating an engaging puzzle experience.
     *Tools:* *tkinter library*
   * [Text-Based Game](https://github.com/Syeda-Farhat/Machine-Learning-and-Python-Projects/tree/main/Texted-Based%20Game)  : This project is an interactive quiz game where users start by running the program and entering their details. They are introduced to the game's rules in the main menu. Players make decisions with 'Y' for yes or 'N' for no, answering questions by entering choices. If the choice selected by the player is right then player will score 1 point and if its wrong then -1.
