This Repository containing portfolio of Machine Learning and Python projects completed by me for academic, and self learning purposes. ML-based projects are in the form of Jupyter notebooks, and Python project are .py files. The Python Projects using different types of data structures, functions and techniques. 
## Instructions for Running Python Notebooks Locally
1. Install dependencies using requirements.txt (if available in project folder) otherwise required libraries are mentioned at the start of each notebook.
2. Run notebooks as usual by using a jupyter notebook server, colab, VScode etc.
3. Dataset or downloadable link is mentioned in each project folder.
# Projects 
   ### Machine Learning 
   * [Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/Syeda-Farhat/Machine-Learning-and-Python-Projects/tree/main/Recommendation_System) : This project delve into the world of recommendation systems, which utilize algorithms to offer personalized suggestions to users, with a focus on content-based and collaborative filtering approaches.

   ### Python
   * [Rock Paper and Scissor Game](https://github.com/Syeda-Farhat/Machine-Learning-and-Python-Projects/tree/main/Rock-Paper-Scissor)  : The Game includes a simple logic encapsulated in an unconditional while loop, encompassing key steps of user input retrieval, validation, and random computer input generation. The game's progression is defined by a concise if-elif-else statement that enforces the game rules.
   * [The Minesweeper Game](https://github.com/Syeda-Farhat/Machine-Learning-and-Python-Projects/tree/main/minesweeper)  :
