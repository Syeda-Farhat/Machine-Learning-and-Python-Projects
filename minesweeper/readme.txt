• The mine detection game is a puzzle game also known as the minesweeper game developed it using Python and tkinter library. 

• The game consists of a grid of hidden square cells with mines randomly scattered throughout the board.

• The cells are opened when clicked and if the user clicks on a cell holding a mine then the user loses.

• Each cell that is not a mine, when clicked on displays the number of mines in the surrounding eight cells.

• Once the user is sure that a cell is a mine, the user can right-click on that cell to mark it as a bomb. A bomb can be above, below, to the left, to the right, or in the cells immediately diagonal to the given cell.

• If the clicked cell shows zero, then the game will automatically open the surrounding cells as well. 

• The user wins the game if they clear all the empty cells without triggering any bombs. 

• And the counter shows the number of remaining cells. And after opening a cell without triggering the mine counter will decrease.
